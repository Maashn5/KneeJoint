# KneeJoint
The knee joint contain of 4 important element
* Links
<br/> The links are the parts that need to be connected via the joint

<br/> [The stl file for the 2nd joint](https://github.com/Maashn5/KneeJoint/blob/main/knee%20joint/second%20link.stl)
* Bearing
<br/> The major benefit for the bearing is to decrease the friction in the joint between the two links

<br/> Note: this bearing is designed by the smart method company
* Pin
<br/> The benefit from the pin is to holds the 2 link togather

<br/>
<br/> If we assemble all of the above we will have the knee joint
